        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Seattle AI Studio, where we pretend to use cutting-edge AI to predict the weather in Seattle based
            on the number of coffee cups consumed in the city. This privacy policy is completely fictional and should
            not be used as a real guideline for data protection.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We collect data about how many times you blink while reading this policy. This data is collected through your
            webcam but don't worry, it's all pretend!</p>

        <h2>Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The blink data is used to adjust the brightness of your screen to match the number of times you blink. Again,
            this is not real, so your screen brightness will stay the same.</p>

            real data because, well, they don't actually exist.</p>

        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share your blink data with Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy to ensure you get gifts that match your
            blinking patterns. Just kidding, we don't share your data with anyone.</p>
