		<p>Congrats! If you're reading this, you've found basically the end of my personal website. I've readily enjoyed the majority of the work i've been involved in, and often forget the one off research pieces or day to day activities that dominate my life. So here are a random smorgasbord of media i've been the subject of, the funniest of these being when UK's talksport radio had me on as an election science "expert" and asked me fantastic questions like "will Clinton be remembered as the worst candidate of all time" on the night of the 2016 election.
